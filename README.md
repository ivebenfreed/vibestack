# VibeStack

## A full stack, local first, edge and AI native framework for data intensive web applications.

## Vision

- ✨ **Offline-First Architecture** - Continue working without an internet connection
- 🔄 **Bi-directional Sync** - Changes flow seamlessly between server and clients
- 💾 **Full SQL in the Browser** - Complete PostgreSQL capabilities via WebAssembly
- 🧠 **Local LLM & NLP Support** - Local, in-browser models for day-to-day operations with heavy loads offloaded to APIs
- 🔌 **Zero Infrastructure** - Serverless deployment with no management overhead
- 🚀 **Edge-Powered Backend** - Cloudflare prmitives and Neon Postgres for low
- Fully automatic LLM freidnly data modal, schema, migration and api factory from a central hub
- 🧰 **Developer Experience** - Type-safe APIs with excellent tooling support


## Core Components

### 1. Server Architecture

- **Single Cloudflare Worker**: Serverless edge runtime for the entire backend
  - Zero infrastructure management
  - Global edge distribution
  - Automatic scaling with traffic demands
- **Hono HTTP Framework**: Lightweight, high-performance API server
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless Postgres database
  - WAL (Write-Ahead Log) based change capture
  - Built-in replication capabilities
  - Branching for development environments
- **ReplicationDO (Durable Object)**: Manages database replication with PostgreSQL's WAL
  - Polls for changes in the database
  - Maintains replication state and log sequence numbers (LSN)
  - Notifies clients of changes in real-time
- **SyncDO (Durable Object)**: Per-client sync manager
  - Manages WebSocket connections for individual clients
  - Filters changes relevant to specific clients
  - Handles client-to-server data synchronization
  - Maintains client session state
  - Implements conflict resolution and last-write-wins semantics

### 2. Client Application

- **React Frontend**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **PGLite Integration**: PostgreSQL in WebAssembly
  - Full SQL database running in the browser
  - Persistent storage with IndexedDB
  - Support for complex queries and transactions
- **WebSocket Sync**: Real-time data synchronization
  - Bidirectional communication with server
  - Efficient change propagation
  - Conflict resolution

### 3. DataForge Entity Manager

- **TypeORM Integration**: ORM and database toolkit
  - Entity definition with decorators
  - Relationship mapping
  - Direct SQL queries instead of query builders
- **Schema Management**: Define entities with TypeScript decorators
- **Type Generation**: Automatic TypeScript type generation
- **Multi-Database Support**: Works with both server PostgreSQL and client PGLite
- **Migration System**: Consistent schema across environments
- **Table Categories**: Domain, System, and Utility table classifications
- **Custom Entity Generator**: Smart context-aware entity management
  - Generates separate server and client entity exports
  - Uses decorators to control property/entity visibility (@ServerOnly, @ClientOnly)
  - Automatically discovers and analyzes entity relationships
  - Builds dependency hierarchies for efficient data synchronization
  - Handles complex entity metadata filtering

> **TODO:** Implement full CRUD API code generation to automatically create type-safe endpoints from entity definitions.

## Change Tracking and Sync Flow

- **WAL-Based Change Capture**: Uses PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Log for efficient change detection
- **LSN (Log Sequence Number) Tracking**: Precisely tracks database changes without extra tables
- **Sync Flow Types**:
  1. **Initial Sync**: Complete data download for new clients
  2. **Catchup Sync**: Selective updates for reconnecting clients
  3. **Live Sync**: Real-time bidirectional updates

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 8
- TypeScript >= 5.5

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:codevibesmatter/vibestack.git
   cd vibestack
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Debug Features (OpenAuth)

**⚠️ WARNING: These features are intended for development and debugging ONLY. They provide direct access to manipulate authentication data and should NEVER be exposed in production.**

The OpenAuth worker (`apps/openauth`) includes a set of internal debug routes accessible under the `/internal` path prefix. These routes provide a simple web interface for inspecting and managing user authentication data stored in the Cloudflare KV namespace (`AUTH_STORE`).

### Accessing the Debug UI

1.  Navigate to `/internal/list-auth-users` in your browser when the worker is running.
2.  **Challenge Required:** For security, access is protected by a simple challenge-response mechanism.
    *   On the first visit, the UI will prompt you for a challenge code.
    *   Check the **worker console logs**. A message like `[OpenAuth] DEBUG CHALLENGE: To access admin UI, use challenge code: <CODE>` will be printed.
    *   Copy the `<code>`.
    *   Append `?challenge=<code>` to the URL (e.g., `/internal/list-auth-users?challenge=ABCDEF`) and refresh the page.

### Features

*   **List Users:** Displays a list of users based on the presence of `email\u001f<email>\u001fsubject` keys found in the KV store.
*   **Delete User Data:** Provides a button next to each listed user to delete all associated authentication data (password hash, email-subject mapping, and any associated refresh tokens). **This action is irreversible.**
*   **Clear All Auth Data:** Provides a button to delete **ALL** authentication data stored in the KV namespace managed by OpenAuth (keys starting with `email\u001f` and `oauth:refresh\u001f`). **This action is extremely destructive and irreversible.** Use with extreme caution.

### Implementation Details

*   All debug route handlers are defined in `apps/openauth/src/debug.ts`.
*   The main worker entry point (`apps/openauth/src/index.ts`) mounts these routes under the `/internal` path.
*   The challenge code is generated randomly per worker instance and reset after successful validation.

## Development

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages and applications
- `pnpm dev` - Start development servers
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm quality` - Run code quality checks

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite for the sync functionality:

```bash
# Run sync tests
pnpm --filter @repo/sync-test test
```
